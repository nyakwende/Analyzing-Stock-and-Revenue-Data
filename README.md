# Analyzing-Stock-and-Revenue-Data

The project aimed to compare the performance of stocks for Tesla and GameStop over time in order to inform stock traders when to buy or sell shares.  The following historical stock information for both companies was extracted using yfinance: Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, Dividends, and Stock Splits. 

Historical revenues for Tesla and GameStop stocks were extracted from their websites using Webscraping. The html data obtained was parsed using the BeautifulSoup library and stored into a dataframe. The dataframe consisted of Date and Revenue columns.

In order to visualize Stock Price and Revenue trends for both Companies over time, a Python function with stock data and revenue data inputs was used to build dashboards which made comparison easier.
